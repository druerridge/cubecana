This codebase now includes the code for the website [www.cubecana.com](https://www.cubecana.com/) which includes most of the functionality described below and more in a more user-friendly format! I recommend you start there, and come back if you feel you need more. There is also a CLI provided which offers some of the same functionality and in some cases a bit more.
